# SOLAR TAB 

Solar tab is a chrome extension made with the goal to provide an new-tab page that contains an approximate real-time simulation of the solar system.

## Why?
The motivation behind it is purely curiosity; I am often wondering what the Earth looks like at any given moment in relation to the sun, how the day/night cycle looks like from space and more. 

I figured that creating an approximate simulation that I will see regularly will not only be an interesting project but also a good way to build intuition about the solar system.

## The completely well thought out plan
1. Get a quick and dirty proof-of-concept up and running making use of external frameworks
2. Once I am satisfied with the layout, I will remove all frameworks and do all the rendering using webGL. This will allow me to have more control over the simulation and visuals.
   
The project is currently in its infancy and due to the high-workload (academics + part-time) I have at the moment it will most likely stay that way for a while.

## Libraries:

Currently, all the rendering is done with AMCHARTS map functionaliy.
